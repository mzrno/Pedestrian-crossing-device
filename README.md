# This project aims to make a device that will monitor the movement of vehicles and pedestrians on a pedestrian crossing. This project will show the safety of pedestrians on pedestrian crossings. The complete structure contains 3 electronic boards with components for the successful operation of the device. On two boards a Teensy 3.6 microcontroller is installed, and on the remaining board, Arduino Nano is installed. The most important component of the device is Scanse Sweep sensor. It provides a two-dimensional scanning with continuous rotation. With the Sweep rotation data of the angle and the distance of related angle is collected. The device stores the collected data on the microSD card. Later, these collected data are processed in MATLAB programming language. The processed data are used to analyze pedestrian safety at the crosswalk. The analysis shows us whether the drivers respect the rules of pedestrians on the crosswalk. The device also has an ArduCAM camera that captures the vehicles that are approaching a pedestrian crossing. Testing of the device at pedestrian crossings showed that the majority of drives respect with the rules of pedestrians, but there were also several cases of disrespect.
