# Created device is used for scanning pedestrian crossings and analysis of their safety.
# Microcontrollers used 2 Teensy 3.6 and 1 Arduino Nano 2.0.
# Devices used Scanse Sweep, LIDAR-Lite v3, 16x2 LCD, 2 Nordic nrf2401l radio modem.
# Arduino, Matlab and Python codes. 
# All 3 Arduino codes are compatible and they depend on each other.
# Collected scans are sent to microSD card on a txt file. After they are transferred to a csv file manually.
# Matlab and Python codes use thoose csv files for analysis.
